Welcome to GNU MDK.

GNU MDK is part of the GNU project [0].

MDK stands for MIX Development Kit, and provides tools for developing
and executing, in a MIX virtual machine, MIXAL programs.

The MIX is Donald Knuth's mythical computer, described in the first
volume of The Art of Computer Programming, which is programmed using
MIXAL, the MIX assembly language.

MDK includes a MIXAL assembler (mixasm) and a MIX virtual machine
(mixvm) with a command line interface.  In addition, a GTK+ GUI to
mixvm, called gmixvm, is provided; and, in case you are an Emacs guy,
you can try misc/mixvm.el, which allows running mixvm inside an Emacs
GUD buffer.

Using these interfaces, you can debug your MIXAL programs at source
code level, and read/modify the contents of all the components of the
MIX computer (including block devices, which are simulated using the
file system).
